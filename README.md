# thunder-create
This repository contains the sources to create one driver:

create.x

This driver calculates all the multi-center interections and stores them into look-up tables. These look-up tables are needed by the fireball calculators - lightning.x lighting-grid.x, and fireball.x to build the tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix elements. 

This piece of code is not open-source, as such it is not hosted here and we
encourage interested researchers to contact the FIREBALL DFT Development Group.
