The driver compute the Fireball interatomic interactions from the wave-functions
created by begin.x
This piece of code is not open-source, as such it is not hosted here and we
encorage interested to contact the Fireball developers for access to the sources
and/or the Interaction data (Fdata) precomputed by this driver.
